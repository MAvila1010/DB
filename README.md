# xlsx to csv conversion

You will have to rename any "input_folder" or "output_folder" to your actual directory names. Your input folder holds your .xlsx files. The output_folder will be automatically created if one does not exist. When your output_folder, input_folder, and xlsx_to_csv.py file are in the same directory run the .py file and any xlsx files in your input folder will convert to csv files in your output folder.
